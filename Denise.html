  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <div class = "first">
  <p> I am a young woman ready to take on the world. I have a lot I want to do and a lot I want to learn.
  I am beyond fasinated with programing and coding in different languages. Its mentally challenging
and I struggle a lot when I attempt to code, but that doesn't mean I am about to stop.</p> <p> I
also am a dancer and a actor. I have been preforming for four year doing a large varitey of different shows.
</p> <p> Even though I have been performing for a long time, I am going to focus on code- since that is my passion- and
act and dance on the side. I love it, but not enough to do it my whole life. </p>
</div>


  <h2> Hometown</h2>
  <div class ="second">
  <P>I grew up in Salnias, CA. I lived there till the age of 14 at which point my dad got a new job
  in LA. I spent my high school years there and I fell in love with the city and all the lights, however,
  I do and always will long for those open roads, fields that stretch out over the horizen, and the endless trees. </p>
</div>
  <h2>University </h2>
  <div class = "third">
  <p> I will be attending the University of Califonria, Santa Cruz in the fall
  of 2017 where I'll get my chance to be back in those green, lush forests that I've missed so much and study the subjuct I love: Computer Science! </p>
